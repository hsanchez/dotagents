# Create PR

Create or update a pull request for the current branch, following the project's PR hygiene rules and ensuring the branch is validated before submission.

## When to use

- Opening a new PR for the current branch.
- Updating the title or body of an existing PR.
- Marking a draft PR ready for review.

## When NOT to use

- Responding to reviewer comments — use `pr-comments`.
- Reviewing someone else's PR — use `review-pr`.

---

## Protocol

### 1. Identify branches

```bash
CURRENT=$(git branch --show-current)
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(GH_PAGER="" gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name 2>/dev/null || echo "main")
```

If `CURRENT` equals `DEFAULT_BRANCH`, stop and tell the user to create a feature branch first, e.g. `git switch -c <feature-branch-name>`.

### 2. Check if a PR already exists and set base branch

```bash
BASE=$(GH_PAGER="" gh pr view --json baseRefName --jq .baseRefName 2>/dev/null)
PR_EXISTS=$?

[ $PR_EXISTS -ne 0 ] && BASE="$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
```

- If `PR_EXISTS` is 0 (PR exists): `BASE` is the PR's current base branch.
- If `PR_EXISTS` is 1 (no PR): `BASE` falls back to `$DEFAULT_BRANCH` (or a user-provided base if one was given).

All subsequent git operations use `$BASE`, not `$DEFAULT_BRANCH`, so PRs against `release/*` or other non-default bases are handled correctly.

### 3. Safety checks

**Working tree must be clean:**

```bash
git status --short
```

If uncommitted or unstaged changes are present, stop and ask the user to commit or stash them before continuing.

**Commits must exist ahead of base:**

```bash
git fetch origin
AHEAD=$(git rev-list --count origin/"$BASE"..HEAD)
```

If `AHEAD` is 0, stop — there is nothing to open a PR for.

### 4. Check branch freshness

Report how far behind the branch is without automatically merging:

```bash
BEHIND=$(git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/"$BASE")
```

If `BEHIND` is greater than 0, tell the user and ask whether to merge before continuing:

- Merge `origin/$BASE` now
- Continue without merging (risk of conflicts during review)
- Stop

If the user chooses to merge:

```bash
git merge origin/"$BASE"
```

Stop if merge conflicts arise. Resolve them locally before continuing.

### 5. Run presubmit checks

Read the project's agent instructions file for required presubmit steps:

```bash
for f in AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md GEMINI.md CODEX.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] && echo "Found: $f" && break
done
```

Follow whatever presubmit requirements are defined there exactly. If no instructions file is found, use these fallback patterns in order:

| Indicator | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| `pyproject.toml` with `prek` | `uv sync && uv run prek run --all-files && uv run pytest` |
| `Makefile` with `test`/`check` | `make check` or `make test` |
| `package.json` with `lint`/`test` | `npm run lint && npm test` |
| `scripts/presubmit` or `script/presubmit` | `./scripts/presubmit` |

If no entry point is found, note the omission in the PR body. Do not assume docs-only or config-only changes skip presubmit — follow the project's own rules on this.

If presubmit fails, stop and fix the failures before proceeding.

### 6. Review your changes

Inspect what is being submitted before writing the PR description:

```bash
# Commits on this branch
git --no-pager log origin/"$BASE"..HEAD --oneline

# Files changed
git --no-pager diff origin/"$BASE"...HEAD --stat

# Full diff
git --no-pager diff origin/"$BASE"...HEAD
```

### 7. Read PR hygiene rules

Check for a project-level agent instructions file and follow any PR hygiene rules it defines. `AGENTS.md` is the cross-agent contract and takes precedence:

```bash
for f in AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md GEMINI.md CODEX.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] && echo "Found: $f" && break
done
```

If no file is found or none defines PR rules, use these defaults:

- **Title**: imperative mood, correctly capitalized, no trailing punctuation. Optional module prefix (`module: Title`). No conventional-commit prefixes (`fix:`, `feat:`, etc.).
- **Body**: include What, Why, and How sections.
- **Release Notes**: required as the final section. One bullet — `- Added ...`, `- Fixed ...`, or `- Improved ...` for user-facing changes; `- N/A` for docs-only or non-user-facing changes.

### 8. Push and preview

Push the branch and ensure the upstream tracking reference is set. This is a no-op if the branch is already up to date:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin "$CURRENT"
```

Then compose the full title and body and show them to the user for confirmation **before running any mutating `gh pr create`, `gh pr edit`, or `gh pr ready` command**. Do not create or update a PR without explicit approval.

### 9. Create or update the PR

Only after the user approves the preview:

**Create a new PR (draft by default):**

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "<title>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## What
<what changed>

## Why
<why it was necessary>

## How
<approach taken>

Release Notes:

- <Added|Fixed|Improved|N/A> ...
EOF
)" \
  --draft
```

**Update an existing PR:**

```bash
gh pr edit \
  --title "<new title>" \
  --body "<new body>"
```

**Mark a draft PR ready for review:**

```bash
gh pr ready
```

---

## After opening

1. Confirm the PR URL, title, base branch, and draft status are correct.
2. Monitor CI — ensure automated checks pass before requesting review.
3. If checks fail, fix locally, push, and re-run validation before marking ready.
4. Keep the branch up to date — merge `origin/$BASE` if new commits land before the PR is merged.

---

## Best practices

- **One logical change per PR** — keep scope focused for easier review.
- **Self-review first** — read your own diff before opening.
- **Write clear commit messages** — explain what and why, not just what.
- **Document breaking changes** — call out API changes or removals explicitly in the PR body.
- **Don't mark ready prematurely** — wait for CI to pass and self-review to complete.

## Error handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `gh` unavailable | Stop. Tell user: `brew install gh && gh auth login` |
| Auth fails | Stop. Run `gh auth login`. |
| On default branch | Stop. Create a feature branch first. |
| Uncommitted changes | Stop. Commit or stash before continuing. |
| No commits ahead of base | Stop. Nothing to PR. |
| Merge conflicts | Stop. Resolve locally before continuing. |
| Presubmit fails | Stop. Fix failures before opening or updating the PR. |
| Push fails | Stop. Report the error before attempting any PR mutation. |
| `gh pr create` fails | Report the error and the full `gh` output. |
