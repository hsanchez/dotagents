# Audit Diff

Audit code changes.

`review-code` is the custom script that constructs the canonical review prompt. Reviewer backends are external command-line tools that consume that prompt.

## When to Use

- Reviewing uncommitted code changes.
- Checking changes before committing or opening a pull request.
- Getting independent review signal from multiple evaluative lenses.
- Filtering review noise through cross-persona confidence tiers.

## When NOT to Use

- `review-code` is unavailable.
- No reviewable changes exist.
- Auditing non-code files only.
- The user wants the current model's own inline review; just ask directly.
- The user wants several models to answer the same open-ended question; use the `council` skill for that.

## Audit Mode

If the user specifies `standard`, run Standard Audit.
If the user specifies `adversarial`, run Adversarial Audit.

If the user does not specify a mode, ask once:

Audit mode?
- Standard audit
- Adversarial audit

# Core Invariants

## Single Prompt Invariant

Run `review-code` exactly once per audit.

Every reviewer must review the exact same prompt produced by that single `review-code` invocation.

Do not re-run `review-code` per reviewer.

## Reviewer Independence Invariant

Reviewers must not see each other's outputs.

Each reviewer receives only the canonical review prompt plus its persona instructions.

Do not run iterative, conversational, or cross-informed review unless the user explicitly asks for that mode.

## Stable Interface Invariant

`review-code` defines the review protocol.

The audit skill coordinates execution, finding extraction, clustering, confidence-tier grouping, cleanup, and reporting.

# Standard Audit

Run from the repository root.

By default this audits uncommitted changes. If the user names a base ref (a branch, tag, or commit to compare against — for example "audit this branch against main"), pass it to `review-code` to audit committed changes relative to that ref, plus any uncommitted changes on top.

1. Check for untracked files:

   ```bash
   git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
   ```

   If any exist, inform the user that untracked files are omitted by
   `review-code` and `git diff`.

   Suggest:

   ```bash
   git add -N <file>
   ```

   Then stop and let the user re-invoke after staging with intent-to-add.

2. Run `review-code` once:

   ```bash
   REVIEW_CODE=scripts/review-code
   command -v "$REVIEW_CODE" >/dev/null 2>&1 || REVIEW_CODE=review-code
   "$REVIEW_CODE" ${BASE_REF:+"$BASE_REF"}
   ```

   `review-code` exits nonzero on a real failure (for example, an invalid base ref). Check the exit code from this command, not just its printed output — a nonzero exit means there is no usable prompt, regardless of what was printed. Stop and relay the error in that case.

3. Treat the output as a review prompt.

   `review-code` produces the prompt. The current model consumes that prompt and produces the actual audit findings.

4. Present findings with file and line references where possible.

5. Stop.

# Adversarial Audit

Run multiple reviewer personas against the same canonical review prompt. Each persona has a different review lens, and each can run on a different backend. Agreement across personas carries stronger signal because they are looking for different classes of failure.

By default this audits uncommitted changes. If the user names a base ref (a branch, tag, or commit to compare against), pass it through as `$BASE_REF` — `review-code` will then audit committed changes relative to that ref, plus any uncommitted changes on top.

## Personas

| Persona    | Focus                                                     | Default backend                       | Persona delivery          | Prompt file                                      |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Auditor    | Correctness, completeness, contract adherence, API misuse | `codex`                               | System/instruction prompt | `.agents/skills/audit/prompts/auditor.txt`       |
| Adversary  | Security, exploitability, high-impact failure modes       | `claude`                              | System prompt             | `.agents/skills/audit/prompts/adversary.txt`     |
| Pragmatist | Maintainability, test coverage, operational cost          | `copilot-gemini` (`gemini-3.5-flash`) | Combined user prompt      | `.agents/skills/audit/prompts/pragmatic.txt`     |

Default: run all three personas on their default backends.

Require at least 2 personas.

## Backends

Overrides are limited to these documented backends. Each backend has a fixed persona-delivery mechanism:

| Backend          | CLI          | Persona delivery                                    |
|------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `claude`         | `claude`     | System prompt (`--system-prompt`)                    |
| `codex`          | `codex`      | Instruction prompt (positional argument to `codex exec`) |
| `copilot-gemini` | `gh copilot` | Combined prompt (no separate system-prompt channel)   |

Any persona can run on any backend in this table. A persona is not tied to its default backend.

If a Copilot backend cannot accept the combined prompt because the prompt is too large, reroute that persona to `codex` and run the same persona there. This is a backend fallback, not a persona failure. If `codex` is unavailable or fails to start, try `claude`. Only mark the persona failed after all non-Copilot fallback backends have failed.

If the user asks for a backend not in this table, tell them it is unsupported and list the table above.

## Gather Context

Ask the user for any parameters not already provided. Ask once.

**Question 1 - Personas**

Skip if personas were already specified.

Which personas should I run?

- All three: Auditor, Adversary, Pragmatist
- Custom: user specifies 2 or more personas

If the user picks fewer than 2 personas, ask them to add another.

**Question 2 - Backend Overrides**

Skip unless the user explicitly asks to change backends.

Which backend should each persona use? Defaults:

- Auditor: `codex`
- Adversary: `claude`
- Pragmatist: `copilot-gemini`

Only accept backends listed in [Backends](#backends). If the user names an unsupported backend, tell them so and ask again.

**Question 3 - Verbosity**

Skip if already specified.

How much output should I show?

- Confidence-tier findings only
- Confidence-tier findings plus disputed and solo findings
- Full verbose output with per-persona details

Default: confidence-tier findings only.

## Diff Preview

Always check for untracked files first:

```bash
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

If any exist, stop and tell the user:

`review-code` and `git diff` ignore untracked files. These files would be silently omitted from the audit.

Suggest:

```bash
git add -N <file>
```

Then let the user re-invoke the audit.

Next show diff stats:

```bash
if [ -n "${BASE_REF:-}" ]; then
  git diff --stat --no-ext-diff "${BASE_REF}...HEAD"
fi
git diff --stat HEAD
```

If both are empty, stop and tell the user there are no changes to audit.

If the diff exceeds 2000 changed lines, warn the user and ask whether to proceed or narrow the scope.

## Review Input

Create a per-run scratch directory and generate the canonical review prompt. Resolve `$OUTPUT_DIR`, `$PROMPT_FILE`, and `$PERSONA_DIR` to absolute paths immediately — reviewer processes run from a neutral working directory (see [Reviewer Working Directory](#reviewer-working-directory)), so relative paths would break:

```bash
mkdir -p .scratch
OUTPUT_DIR=$(mktemp -d .scratch/audit-outputs.XXXXXX)
OUTPUT_DIR=$(cd "$OUTPUT_DIR" && pwd)
PROMPT_FILE=$(mktemp .scratch/review-prompt.XXXXXX)
PROMPT_FILE="$(cd "$(dirname "$PROMPT_FILE")" && pwd)/$(basename "$PROMPT_FILE")"
PERSONA_DIR="$(cd .agents/skills/audit/prompts && pwd)"
REVIEWER_CWD=$(mktemp -d)
trap 'rm -f "${PROMPT_FILE:-}"; rm -rf "${OUTPUT_DIR:-}" "${REVIEWER_CWD:-}"' EXIT

REVIEW_CODE=scripts/review-code
command -v "$REVIEW_CODE" >/dev/null 2>&1 || REVIEW_CODE=review-code
"$REVIEW_CODE" ${BASE_REF:+"$BASE_REF"} > "$PROMPT_FILE"
REVIEW_CODE_EXIT=$?
```

The `trap` is the authoritative cleanup mechanism for this run — it fires on normal completion, error, or interruption. The explicit cleanup step in [Cleanup](#cleanup) is a fallback for a session that cannot rely on shell traps, not a replacement.

Check the exit code before trusting `$PROMPT_FILE`. `review-code` exits nonzero on a real failure — for example an invalid `$BASE_REF` — and in that case `$PROMPT_FILE` does not contain a usable prompt:

```bash
if [ "$REVIEW_CODE_EXIT" -ne 0 ]; then
  # stop and relay the error review-code printed; do not proceed to execution
fi
```

Only once `review-code` has exited 0 should you check for the no-changes sentinel:

```bash
if grep -qE "^No (uncommitted changes to review|changes to review relative to)" "$PROMPT_FILE"; then
  # stop and inform the user there are no changes to review
fi
```

Use the persona prompt as a system or instruction prompt when the backend supports that separation. Use the canonical review prompt as the user prompt.

For Copilot backends, build a combined input file because `gh copilot` does not provide a separate system prompt channel:

```bash
{
  cat "$PERSONA_DIR/<persona>.txt"
  echo
  echo "Apply the lens above exclusively. Disregard any generic role framing in the instructions below."
  echo
  echo "---"
  echo
  cat "$PROMPT_FILE"
} > "$OUTPUT_DIR/input-<persona>"
```

Claude and Codex personas consume the persona prompt separately from `$PROMPT_FILE`. Copilot personas consume their combined input file.

Do not re-run `review-code`.

## Execution

Output filenames are opaque identifiers. Each persona writes to a unique file inside `$OUTPUT_DIR`. The manifest is the source of truth for the mapping from persona name to output file.

Run selected personas independently. Prefer parallel execution when supported. Set a timeout of 600000 milliseconds for each reviewer process.

Only write a manifest entry on success, determined by exit code, not by whether stdout is empty. A failed persona's output, including partial stdout, is not a valid review result and must not receive a manifest entry.

### Reviewer Working Directory

Backend CLIs (notably `codex`) auto-load configuration from the current working directory on startup — `.codex/config.toml`, `.agents/`, etc. Running them from the audited repo's root means they load that repo's own agent configuration, which can break sandboxed startup (for example, `--sandbox read-only` rejecting the PATH-alias step Codex performs during init).

The canonical prompt already contains the full diff, so reviewers do not need to start inside the repository. Launch every backend from a neutral working directory using absolute paths only:

```bash
REVIEWER_CWD=$(mktemp -d)
```

Wrap each invocation in a subshell that `cd`s into `$REVIEWER_CWD` first, as shown in [Default Backend Invocations](#default-backend-invocations). Every path passed to a reviewer (`$PROMPT_FILE`, `$PERSONA_DIR/<persona>.txt`, `$OUTPUT_DIR/...`) must already be absolute for this to work.

If a backend still fails to initialize from a neutral directory, treat it as a genuine startup failure — do not retry inside the repo root, since that reintroduces the same repo-local config problem. Report the exact startup error (see [Error Handling](#error-handling)).

### Copilot Prompt Limit and Fallback

`gh copilot` passes the combined prompt via `--prompt` as a command-line argument. Before invoking any `copilot-*` backend, check the combined input file size. If it exceeds the safe limit derived from the operating system argument limit, do not skip the persona. Reroute that persona to a non-Copilot backend using the same persona prompt and canonical review prompt.

Use this shell approximation when no better runtime helper is available:

```bash
if [ "$(wc -c < "$OUTPUT_DIR/input-<persona>")" -gt 200000 ]; then
  BACKEND_<persona>=codex
fi
```

Fallback order for an oversized Copilot prompt:

1. `codex`
2. `claude`

When a persona is rerouted, record the actual backend used in the summary. Do not include the failed Copilot attempt in `Failed personas`; it was never invoked.

### Default Backend Invocations

**Auditor - codex**

```bash
(
  cd "$REVIEWER_CWD" && \
  codex exec --sandbox read-only --ephemeral \
    -o "$OUTPUT_DIR/audit-output-NN" \
    "$(cat "$PERSONA_DIR/auditor.txt")" < "$PROMPT_FILE" \
    2> "$OUTPUT_DIR/auditor.stderr"
)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  printf '%s\t%s\n' "auditor" "$OUTPUT_DIR/audit-output-NN" \
    >> "$OUTPUT_DIR/manifest.tsv"
fi
```

**Adversary - claude**

```bash
(
  cd "$REVIEWER_CWD" && \
  claude --system-prompt "$(cat "$PERSONA_DIR/adversary.txt")" \
    --print < "$PROMPT_FILE" \
    > "$OUTPUT_DIR/audit-output-NN" \
    2> "$OUTPUT_DIR/adversary.stderr"
)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  printf '%s\t%s\n' "adversary" "$OUTPUT_DIR/audit-output-NN" \
    >> "$OUTPUT_DIR/manifest.tsv"
fi
```

**Pragmatist - copilot-gemini**

```bash
(
  cd "$REVIEWER_CWD" && \
  gh copilot -- --model gemini-3.5-flash --prompt "$(cat "$OUTPUT_DIR/input-pragmatist")" --silent \
    > "$OUTPUT_DIR/audit-output-NN" \
    2> "$OUTPUT_DIR/pragmatist.stderr"
)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  printf '%s\t%s\n' "pragmatist" "$OUTPUT_DIR/audit-output-NN" \
    >> "$OUTPUT_DIR/manifest.tsv"
fi
```

An exit code of 0 with empty stdout is a valid result: the persona found nothing. A nonzero exit code is always a failure, regardless of what was written to stdout — never report it as "no findings." Read the matching `.stderr` file to report or diagnose the failure.

If a persona is assigned or rerouted to a backend other than its default, use that backend's persona-delivery mechanism from the [Backends](#backends) table, following the invocation shape of the matching example above (`claude` → system prompt, `codex` → instruction prompt, `copilot-gemini` → combined prompt).

## Execution Quorum

Execution quorum is separate from confidence tiers.

Default execution quorum: 2 successful personas.

If fewer than 2 personas succeed, abort the audit and report which personas failed.

## Finding Extraction

Read `$OUTPUT_DIR/manifest.tsv` to map each output file to its persona name. Parse and normalize each output file into a common finding structure:

```text
ReviewFinding

persona
severity
file
line
title
description
fix
category
confidence
fingerprint
verdict
```

Required fields:

- persona
- severity
- title
- description

Preferred fields:

- file
- line
- fix
- category
- confidence
- fingerprint
- verdict

If a persona returns prose instead of structured findings, extract findings conservatively.

Do not invent file or line references.

## Semantic Clustering

Merge findings that describe the same underlying issue.

Equivalent findings may use different wording. They should cluster into one issue if they refer to the same code path and same failure mode.

Clustering should consider:

- file
- line or nearby line range
- affected symbol or function
- bug category
- described failure mode

## Confidence Tiers

Replace flat agreement-count ordering with confidence tiers derived from cross-persona agreement:

| Tier            | Definition                                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| cross-validated | Reported by all active personas                 |
| consensus       | Reported by 2 or more personas, but not all     |
| disputed        | Reported by 1 persona and challenged by another |
| solo            | Reported by exactly 1 persona, unchallenged     |

Present tiers in order: cross-validated, consensus, disputed, solo.

Within each tier, order by severity, then file path, then line number.

Cross-validated and consensus findings always appear. Disputed and solo findings are hidden unless verbose mode is enabled.

## Severity Reconciliation

When personas disagree on severity, choose the highest severity only if the description supports it.

Otherwise choose the median practical severity.

Severity order:

```text
CRITICAL
HIGH
MEDIUM
LOW
INFO
```

Do not inflate severity just because one persona used stronger wording.

## Verdict Reconciliation

Derive the final verdict from each successful persona's emitted `verdict:` line. If a persona did not emit a verdict, exclude it from the verdict count.

Use this summary scale:

- `SHIP`: all successful personas approved and there are no cross-validated or
  consensus findings, or the only remaining findings are `INFO`.
- `SHIP-WITH-CAVEATS`: at least one successful persona emitted `conditional`,
  or only `LOW` or `MEDIUM` findings remain.
- `NEEDS-WORK`: at least one successful persona emitted `rejected`, or at least
  one `CRITICAL` or `HIGH` finding remains.

If no verdicts were emitted, omit the verdict line and report that persona verdicts were unavailable.

## Output

Present findings grouped by confidence tier, then by severity:

```text
NEEDS-WORK (1/3 approved, 1/3 conditional, 1/3 rejected)

Successful personas: auditor, adversary, pragmatist
Failed personas: none

Cross-validated findings: 1
Consensus findings: 2
Disputed findings: 0
Solo findings: 0

## Cross-Validated

CRITICAL
auth.py:42

Missing authorization check before account update.

Fix: Add `require_permission()` before any state mutation in this handler.

Personas:
- auditor
- adversary
- pragmatist

## Consensus

HIGH
worker.py:88

Retry loop can repeat a non-idempotent operation.

Fix: Add an idempotency key or move the retry boundary around only the safe read operation.

Personas:
- auditor
- pragmatist
```

If there are no cross-validated or consensus findings, say no finding met the confidence threshold. Do not claim the code is correct.

If verbose mode is enabled, include disputed and solo findings after consensus findings, clearly separated by tier.

## Failure Handling

A persona has failed when its process exits nonzero, regardless of what was written to stdout. Empty stdout with a zero exit code is a successful run with no findings — do not conflate the two. Determine success from the exit code captured in [Default Backend Invocations](#default-backend-invocations), never from output emptiness alone.

If a persona fails:

- Continue if at least 2 personas succeed.
- Exclude failed personas from confidence tiers and verdict counts.
- Report failures in the summary, including the exit code and the relevant `.stderr` file content.

If fewer than 2 personas succeed:

- Abort the adversarial audit.
- Report failed personas and suggested fixes.

If aggregation fails:

- Stop immediately.
- Report the failure.
- Clean up scratch files.

## Error Handling

| Error                           | Action                                                                  |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `review-code` unavailable       | Stop and report that the review prompt generator is unavailable.        |
| `review-code` failed            | Stop immediately. Check `$REVIEW_CODE_EXIT`, not `$PROMPT_FILE` content — a nonzero exit means the file is not a usable prompt (for example, an invalid `$BASE_REF`). |
| No changes to review            | Stop and report that there are no changes to audit (uncommitted, or relative to `$BASE_REF`). |
| `gh: command not found`         | Tell user: `brew install gh && gh extension install github/gh-copilot`  |
| `gh copilot` missing            | Tell user: `gh extension install github/gh-copilot`                     |
| `claude: command not found`     | Tell user to install Claude Code.                                       |
| `codex: command not found`      | Tell user: `npm i -g @openai/codex`                                     |
| Codex fails to initialize under `--sandbox read-only` (PATH-alias or app-server errors) | Confirm the invocation ran from `$REVIEWER_CWD`, not the repo root. If it still fails, treat as a genuine failure and report the exact startup error from `auditor.stderr` — do not retry inside the repo root. |
| Copilot prompt exceeds limit   | Reroute that persona to `codex`, then `claude` if needed. Treat as failed only if every non-Copilot fallback fails. |
| Reviewer timeout                | Exclude reviewer; continue if quorum remains.                           |
| Reviewer exits nonzero          | Treat as failed regardless of stdout content; report exit code and stderr.|
| Fewer than 2 successful reviews | Abort adversarial audit.                                                |
| Aggregation failed              | Stop and report failure.                                                |

## Cleanup

Scratch files must be removed regardless of success, failure, timeout, reviewer failure, or user cancellation.

The `trap` set in [Review Input](#review-input) is the primary cleanup mechanism — it removes `$PROMPT_FILE`, `$OUTPUT_DIR`, and `$REVIEWER_CWD` automatically when that shell session exits, including on error or interruption. Treat the steps below as an explicit fallback: run them if the trap-owning shell session has already ended (for example, execution moved to a new session) or if you cannot rely on shell traps in the current environment.

After aggregation completes, or on failure, run cleanup as an explicit final
step:

```bash
rm -f "${PROMPT_FILE:-}"
rm -rf "${OUTPUT_DIR:-}"
rm -rf "${REVIEWER_CWD:-}"
```

If the run was interrupted before cleanup, stale files remain under `.scratch/` and in the system temp directory. Inform the user and suggest:

```bash
rm -f .scratch/review-prompt.* && rm -rf .scratch/audit-outputs.*
```

`$REVIEWER_CWD` lives outside `.scratch/` (it must be a neutral directory, not one inside the audited repo) — if orphaned, it is an empty temp directory with no reviewer output in it, since reviewers only ever write to `$OUTPUT_DIR`.

If debugging is needed, ask before preserving scratch files.
